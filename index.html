     <h3>What is Journaling?</h3> 
      <p1>  Journaling is the practice of keeping a diary or journal that explores thoughts and feelings surrounding the events of your life.It's simply writing down your thoughts and feelings to understand them more clearly. And if you struggle with stress, depression, or anxiety, keeping a journal can be a great idea. It can help you gain control of your emotions and improve your mental health. </p1>
         <h4> Why I like journaling?</h4> 
      <p2> 
   Not only are journals a great way to revisit my past memories, but they’re also a great way to see my personal and spiritual growth.Journaling is a place for me to pour out frustrations in a way that’s not harmful to anyone. When I remember to journal, it keeps me from complaining and dragging down a friend with my bad attitude and it keeps me from gossiping. Writing a journal allows me to keep track of my life and the events that took place. The journals also serves to be a valuable piece of writing later in life when I want to sit back and reminisce over the past years. </section> </p2>
